Idea to explore in the future:
Say we have a "random walk" in which there are n Ups and n Downs, ordered randomly.
What is the expected value of the MAX point of this walk?

Inspired by green book q17 ticket line, in which we find the # of paths that never go below 0
by counting the # of paths that hit -1 with the reflection principle
