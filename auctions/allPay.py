# All pay auction for $1 (common value)
# Sealed auction
# Nash equilibrium?
# Vary # of players

# 1. expected total revenue cannot be negative (otherwise we just don't participate)
# 2. no pure strategy
    # if we bid x < $1, someone bids incrementally higher
# 3. mixed strategy
    # Expected Total Pay in mixed strategy must be <= 1
    # otherwise we are losing money overall

    # Expected Total Pay must be = 1
    # F(b) = (b/100)^(1/(N-1)) for 0<=b<=100
    # F(b) is cdf
    # ex. 2 players: F(b) = b/100
