Total gain(sigma) = Sum of Action Gain

Action gain(a, sigma) = max(0, u(a, sigma) - u(sigma))
    u(a, sigma) is utility if I play a, and all others play sigma
    u(sigma) is utility if all play sigma

    only profitable deviations considered

our goal is to MINIMIZE Total gain
    when total gain == 0, there are no profitable deviationa (so it is an equilibrium)
